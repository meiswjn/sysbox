The folder .agents contains a folder "insights" with records of previously gained insights and activity. Use it to not always re-iterate over the whole project.

The folder .agents contains a folder "log". In there, keep logs of your activities, including commands run, files changed, and reasoning steps taken.

When prompted to reflect on the insights, validate if the recorded insights in the folder "insights" are still valid and up-to-date. Change them, if necessary, but include the previous insights as well with an explanation on why they are false.

Use Git to regularly commit your changes.
